		<p class="par2">&emsp; &emsp;Have you are walked around your town, then noticed this big, red-bricked building filled with books and buzzing with people from here and there. Yepp you guessed it, a library. I'm not talking about National Books store or Fullybooked; neither of those are libraries. (No, this is not sponsored) </p>
		<p>&emsp; &emsp;A Library is a collection of resources in a variety of formats organized by information professionals. This building provides convenient physical, digital, bibliographic, or intellectual access offering a variety of targeted services and programs with the mission of educating, informing, or entertaining a variety of audiences. Its goal is to stimulate individual learning and advancing society as a whole. </p>
		<p class="par2">&emsp; &emsp;Libraries have 5 basic functions.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Identifying and acquiring resources, comprising of print, AV, and electronic resources. </li>
			<li>Organizing resources to promote accessibility. Once obtained, resources should be organized, described, and presented in such a way that users can efficiently find them. Bibliographic description, search tools and classification systems serve this function.</li>
			<li>Conserving and preserving materials,ensuring that knowledge and information remain available over time regardless of format</li>
			<li> Providing educational programs. As a cultural institution, libraries have served as places where people come to learn.</li>
			<li>Maintaining effective operations, including general administration, financial management, HR, marketing/PR, IT, maintenance and security.</li>
		</ol>
		<p class="par2">&emsp; &emsp;In a one-person library these tasks are undertaken by a single person. You call this person a "librarian". Kinda makes you wanna rethink about how you look at librarians, huh? Librarians are responsible for looking at the information needs of the primary customers of a particular library. Then they look at the information and library resources that are available to meet those needs. Finally, they plan strategies that will make the most relevant information sources available to their primary clientele in ways that will be most useful to those individuals.</p>
