			<p id="parag"> &emsp; &emsp; Hi! I'm sure you're wondering what LIS means and how is it even relevant to our contemporary time. You might have even already jumped to the conclusion that "Oh, it's just a bunch of people organizing books in a bookshelf then getting mad at you if you dont return the books on time". Don't worry, we won't judge but that's not even the tip of the iceberg! </p>

		<div class="par2">
			<p id="parag"> &emsp; &emsp; Library and Information Science (LIS) is a profession that is full of people passionate about making a positive change in the world, and they tend to be wildly happy about what they do. It begins with the presentation of different attitudes towards LIS and the divergence between LIS as a knowledge producing and knowledge utilizing area. It goes on to discuss the different labels for the discipline, its institutional affiliations and some technology driven paradigms. Fields of LIS practices, examples of concrete research problems and the fundamental concepts are introduced as are subareas, theories, related disciplines, and approaches.  </p>

			<p id="parag"> &emsp; &emsp; As you can see, there is a lot more going on to this field rather than just what you'd expect. Progressing through this website, you shall understand more and more about this profession and see how important this field actually is. So go on ahead. Choose which one you'd like to learn more about. </p>
